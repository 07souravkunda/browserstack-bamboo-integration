Development

`atlas-run`. This will install the plugin in a separate Bamboo instance and starts it on port 6990.

In a separate tab use
`atlas-mvn package` to compile after any changes (this will autoreload the plugin inside the running bamboo instance)





Here are the SDK commands you can use:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
